Schema Services
===============

Metadata schemas can be plugged into GeoNetwork - see :ref:`schemaPlugins`. Any application that needs to:

- find information (eg. names, versions, namespaces, converters) about metadata schemas that are plugged into GeoNetwork should use the :ref:`xml.info` service
- find information about the schema elements and codelists should use the ``xml.schema.info`` service described in this section of the manual
- add, delete, update schema plugins in GeoNetwork should use the ``xml.metadata.schema.add``, ``xml.metadata.schema.delete`` and ``xml.metadata.schema.update`` services described in this section of the manual 

Metadata Schema Information (xml.info?type=schemas)
---------------------------------------------------

See :ref:`xml.info` for more details.

.. index:: xml.schema.info

Schema Element and Codelist Information (xml.schema.info)
---------------------------------------------------------

This service returns information about a set of schema elements or codelists.
The returned information consists of a localised label, a description,
conditions that the element must satisfy etc.

Request
```````

Requests to this service can only be made using the HTTP POST binding with
application/XML content type. Requests can ask for information on multiple  
elements and codelists from different schemas. Description of the request fields
is as follows:

- **element**: Must contain a **schema** and a **name** attribute. The schema attribute must be the name of a schema currently registered in GeoNetwork (see :ref:`xml.info` for more details). The name attribute must be the qualified name of the metadata schema element on which information is required. Other optional attributes can be specified to help determine the appropriate context for the metadata element. These optional attributes are:

  - **context**: The qualified name of the metadata schema element that is the parent of the element specified in the **name** attribute.
  - **fullContext**: The qualified xpath of the element specified in the **name** attribute.
  - **isoType**: For profiles of ISO19115/19139 only. The qualified name of the element in the base ISO19115/19139 schema that the element specified in the **name** attribute is a substitute for. eg. in the Marine Community Profile of ISO19115/19139, ``mcp:MD_Metadata`` is a substitute for ``gmd:MD_Metadata`` in the base ISO19115/19139 metadata schema.

- **codelist**: Accepts a **schema** and **name** attribute as for **element** but information on any codelist associated with the qualified name of the metadata schema element in the **name** attribute will be returned instead.

::

    <request>
        <element schema="iso19139" name="gmd:constraintLanguage" />
        <codelist schema="iso19115" name="DateTypCd" />
    </request>

.. note:: The text returned is localised into the language specified in the 
  the service call. eg. A call to /geonetwork/srv/eng/xml.schema.info
  will return text in the English (eng) language.

Response
````````

If the request executed successfully then HTTP status code 200 will be returned along with an XML document containing the response. The root field of the response will be populated with information about the element/codelist specified in the request. The fields of the response are:

- **element**: A container for information about a schema element. It has a
  name attribute which contains the qualified name of the element.

  - **label**: The human readable name of the element, localised
    into the language specified in the request.
  - **description**: A generic description of the element.
  - **condition \[0..1]**: This field is optional and indicates
    if the element must satisfy a condition eg. mandatory. The condition text
    is displayed with the element name so it intended to be human readable.

- **codelist**: A container for information about a codelist. It has a
  name attribute which contains the qualified name of the codelist.

  - **entry \[1..n]**: A container for a codelist entry. There can
    be more than one entry.

    - **code**: The entry code. This is the value that
      will be used in the metadata.
    - **label**: This is a human readable name for the code, used to
      show the code in the user interface. It is localised.
    - **description**: A localised description/meaning of the code. The 
      description is shown in the user interface with the label.

Error management
````````````````

If an exception occurs during the processing of the request, then an HTTP 500 
status code is returned along with an XML document describing the exception. See :ref:`exception_handling` for more details. 

Apart from exceptions, the service can encounter errors trying to retrieve an element/codelist information eg. if the requested element is not present. If such an error is encountered, then the object is copied from the response and an error attribute is added describing the error. An example of such a response is::

    <response>
        <element schema="iso19139" name="blablabla" error="not-found"/>
    </response>
