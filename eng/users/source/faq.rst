Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

This is a list of frequently encountered problems, suggestions that help to find the cause of the problem and possible solutions. The list is by no means exhaustive. Feel free to contribute by submitting new problems and their solutions to the developer mailing list.

.. note:: <install directory> is a placeholder for the GeoNetwork web application directory (eg. <your_tomcat>/webapps/geonetwork or <your_jetty>/web/geonetwork). <some file> should be read as some random file name.
  
.. warning:: Be very careful when issuing commands on the terminal! You can easily damage your operating system with no way back. If you are not familiar with using the terminal: **don't do it, contact an expert instead!** Make a backup of your data before you make any of the suggested changes below!

HTTP Status 400 Bad request
---------------------------

Check the availability and write permissions of the data and tmp directories. 

See :ref:`temp-dir` and :ref:`data-dir`.

Metadata insert fails
---------------------

Inserting an XML or MEF file through the Metadata insert form fails silently. Verify if the data directory is available and writable.

See :ref:`temp-dir` and :ref:`data-dir`.

Thumbnail insert fails
----------------------

Nothing happens when inserting a thumbnail through the wizard in the metadata editor.

Error in your log file looks like::

  HTTP Status 400 - Cannot build ServiceRequest Cause : <install directory>/data/tmp/<some file> (No such file or directory) Error : java.io.FileNotFoundException

Then check :ref:`temp-dir` and :ref:`data-dir`.

.. _temp-dir:

The data/tmp directory
----------------------

This directory is used as a staging area for file uploads and image/thumbnail operations. On Linux or OS X systems verify from a terminal if the ``<install directory>/data/tmp`` directory exists and is writable.

:command:`ls -la <install directory>/data` 

This should show the permissions on the data directory. For example, if you are running tomcat::

  total 0
  drwxr-xr-x   6 tomcat  tomcat  204 19 jan 15:34 .
  drwxr-xr-x   8 tomcat  tomcat  272 23 dec 19:30 ..
  drwxr-xr-x   3 tomcat  tomcat  102 19 jan 15:47 tmp

The above example shows that only the user tomcat has write access on the directories listed. All other users have read (and execute) rights only. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_permissions for more details on file permissions.

Make sure your web server is running as user tomcat. Check this with the command:

:command:`ps aux | grep tomcat`
  
You should see the processes that have tomcat in their description. Something like this::

  bash-3.2# ps aux | grep tomcat
  tomcat     22253   0,7  0,0  2435120    532 s000  S+    5:03pm   0:00.00 grep tomcat
  tomcat     22251   0,0  1,9  2861960  80596 s000  S     5:03pm   0:03.85 /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK/Home/bin/java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.0.32/conf/logging.properties -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager -Djava.endorsed.dirs=/usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.0.32/endorsed -classpath /usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.0.32/bin/bootstrap.jar -Dcatalina.base=/usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.0.32 -Dcatalina.home=/usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.0.32 -Djava.io.tmpdir=/usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.0.32/temp org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap start

If all is well, the user referred to at the start of this string (in this case tomcat) is the same user that has write permissions on the data and tmp directories.

You now have two possible solutions:

- Make the data and temporary directories writable to all users. You can change this using the command:

:command:`chmod -R a+w <install directory>/data`
  
Your permissions should now look like this::

    drwxrwxrwx   6 tomcat  tomcat  204 19 jan 15:34 .
    etc..
    
.. note:: the 'w' refers to 'write' access

- The second solution is to ensure the user running the webserver is the same user that holds write access to the data directory (in this case tomcat). For this, you can (a) change the user running the process, or (b) change ownership of the directory using the chown command:

:command:`chown -R tomcat:tomcat <install directory>/data`

.. _data-dir:

What/Where is the GeoNetwork data directory?
--------------------------------------------

At GeoNetwork 2.8: 

- metadata data (files uploaded with the metadata and thumbnails)
- the Lucene index
- plugin configurations (schema plugins, thesauri etc)

have been moved into a single directory. By default, this directory is ``<install directory>/WEB-INF/data``, but it can be located on any filesystem accessible to the GeoNetwork server and the different subdirectories can even be placed in 
different directories. See :ref:`geonetwork_data_dir` for more details. For the purposes of this FAQ, we'll assume that the GeoNetwork data directory is ``<install directory>/WEB-INF/data`` because the same principles apply no matter where the data directory is located. 

Check that the user running your webserver (eg. tomcat) has permissions over this directory.

:command:`ls -la <install directory>/WEB-INF/data`

Your should see something like the following::
 
 total 0
 drwxr-xr-x   5 tomcat tomcat  170 Jan  8 01:17 .
 drwxr-xr-x  48 tomcat tomcat 1632 Jan  8 01:17 ..
 drwxr-xr-x   5 tomcat tomcat  170 Jan  8 01:17 config
 drwxr-xr-x   5 tomcat tomcat  170 Jan  8 01:17 data
 drwxr-xr-x   9 tomcat tomcat  306 Jan  8 10:04 index

If all is well, then the tomcat user will have write permissions on all sub directories.

If not then you should ensure that the user running the webserver is the same user that holds write access to the GeoNetwork data directory (in this case tomcat). For this, you can (a) change the user running the process, or (b) change ownership of the directory using the chown command:

:command:`chown -R tomcat:tomcat <install directory>/WEB-INF/data`

The base maps are not visible

**GeoServer** may not have started properly. Confirm this by trying to connect to http://<yourdomain>:8080/geoserver (on your local machine this is http://localhost:8080/geoserver )

Native JAI error on Jetty
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Error in output.log::

  sun.misc.ServiceConfigurationError: javax.imageio.spi.ImageOutputStreamSpi: Provider com.sun.media.imageioimpl.stream.ChannelImageOutputStreamSpi could not be instantiated: java.lang.SecurityException: sealing violation: package com.sun.media.imageioimpl.stream is sealed.

Jetty by default ships with a classloader that does not conform to the Java classloading model: 
you'll notice because GeoServer will fail all (:term:`JAI`) usage attempt with a "sealing violation" exception. 
It can be restored to standard behaviour locating the etc/jetty-webapps.xml configuration file and 
changing the web app context configuration to look like the following::

	<Configure id="Server" class="org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server">
    <Ref id="DeploymentManager">
          <Call id="webappprovider" name="addAppProvider">
            <Arg>
              <New class="org.eclipse.jetty.deploy.providers.WebAppProvider">
                <Set name="monitoredDir"><Property name="jetty.home" default="." />/../web</Set>
                <Set name="defaultsDescriptor"><Property name="jetty.home" default="."/>/etc/webdefault.xml</Set>
                <Set name="scanInterval">1</Set>
                <Set name="contextXmlDir"><Property name="jetty.home" default="." />/contexts</Set>
                <Set name="extractWars">true</Set>
                
                <!-- uncomment in case of a JAI usage attempt with a "sealing violation" exception -->
                <Set name="parentLoaderPriority">true</Set>
                
              </New>
            </Arg>
          </Call>
    </Ref>
  </Configure>

.. note:: The important line is the one where the **parentLoaderPriority** property is set to **true**
